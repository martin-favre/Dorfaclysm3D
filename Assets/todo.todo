☐ Usability
    ✔ Rework camera so it scrolls through Z-levels @done(20-11-01 11:42)
    ☐ Make requests cancellable
        ☐ Move responsibility of requests from the requestpool to the requesters.
            The requesters need to have the ability to act when the request is finished,
            cancelled or just removed in loading. They also need the ability after loading
            Unity does not have any robust GUID system (C# has GUIDs, but I can't easily assign it to a gameobject)
            Therefore make it so the requesters own their requests. OnSave they will store their own requests.
            Then OnLoad they will post them again.
    ☐ Make buttons for swapping between Mining, Building and cancelling
    ☐ Make buttons for spawning Dorfs
    ☐ Make buttons for save/loading
    ☐ Make dorfs have a popup noting what they're doing
        A little symbol, like 
        "..." if they are calculating something
        "!" if their job is cancelled
        "?" if they looking for a new job

☐ World Generation
    ???

☐ Bugs            
    ☐ Why do dorf with walkrandomlyjob stop and wait for so long
    ☐ Blocks disappear/become seethrough
    ☐ Dorfs walk strange

☐ Other
    ☐ Show different sprite for different sides of block
    ☐ Look into testing
        Refactor and ensure I have at least some basic unit testing system.
        Because testing things manually takes too much time.
